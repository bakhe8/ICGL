# 🏛️ Consensus AI

### A Governance‑First Intelligence System for Long‑Lived Decisions

**Consensus AI** is not a chatbot, not a copilot, and not an automation tool. It is a governed reasoning system that transforms complex decisions into auditable, traceable, and human‑sovereign outcomes.

The system exists to protect meaning, prevent silent drift, and keep humans in full control of critical decisions while still benefiting from machine intelligence.

## 🧭 What Is The System?

Consensus AI is a **Decision Governance Engine**.

It accepts a proposal, architectural decision, or strategic question and processes it through:

1. **Canonical knowledge**
2. **Hard policies**
3. **Multi-agent analysis**
4. **Sentinel risk detection**
5. **Historical memory**

It then presents a synthesized decision package to a human, requiring explicit approval and recording the outcome as institutional knowledge.

## 🧠 Philosophy

1. **Intelligence without governance is dangerous**: Raw intelligence amplifies mistakes if not bounded by rules.
2. **The real enemy is silent drift**: Systems fail slowly when meanings erode implicitly.
3. **Unknown risks must be contained**: Detection, isolation, and learning matter more than prediction.
4. **Humans remain sovereign**: No core rule changes without explicit human approval.
5. **Strategic optionality**: The core must support future directions without rewrites.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **🛡️ Governance**: Prevent conceptual drift, enforce boundaries, maintain accountability.
- **🧠 Knowledge**: Build institutional memory, capture ADRs as reusable knowledge.
- **⚙️ Operational**: Support complex decisions, reduce long-term risk, standardize quality.

## 🧩 Core Architecture (The Kernel)

- **Knowledge Base**: Canonical source of truth (Concepts, Policies, Signals, ADRs).
- **ICGL**: The evolution engine (Iterative Co-Governance Loop).
- **Sentinel**: System immune layer for detecting drift and anomalies.
- **Concept Guardian**: Protects conceptual integrity and meaning.
- **HDAL**: Human Decision Authority Layer (Final sovereign signature).
- **Policies**: Hard constraints that cannot be overridden.

## 🔁 Lifecycle

1. Proposal submitted
2. ADR drafted
3. Policy gate enforced
4. Sentinel scanning
5. Agent analysis & synthesis
6. Human sovereign decision
7. Knowledge base update
8. Next iteration

---

## 🧪 Current State

The repository contains a minimal, governance-focused Python skeleton:

- In-memory Knowledge Base (v0)
- ICGL orchestrator
- Placeholder Sentinel & HDAL
- CLI integration (`autobeto consensus`)

---

## 🚀 Future Directions

Consensus AI is designed to evolve into a personal cognitive engine, an enterprise platform, or a research laboratory without changing its foundational kernel.
