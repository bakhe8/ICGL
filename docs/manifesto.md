# 🏛️ Consensus AI — Readme / Manifesto

## 🏛️ Consensus AI

**A Governance‑First Intelligence System for Long‑Lived Decisions**

Consensus AI is not a chatbot, not a copilot, and not an automation tool. It is a governed reasoning system that transforms complex decisions into auditable, traceable, and human‑sovereign outcomes.

The system exists to protect meaning, prevent silent drift, and keep humans in full control of critical decisions while still benefiting from machine intelligence.

---

## 🧭 What Is The System?

Consensus AI is a **Decision Governance Engine**.

It accepts:

- A proposal / architectural decision / strategic question

It processes it through:

- Canonical knowledge
- Hard policies
- Multi‑agent analysis
- Sentinel risk detection
- Historical memory

It then:

- Presents a synthesized decision package to a human
- Requires explicit human approval or rejection
- Records the outcome as institutional knowledge

The system optimizes decision correctness and durability, not speed.

## 🧠 Philosophy

### 1. Intelligence without governance is dangerous

Raw intelligence amplifies mistakes if not bounded by rules, memory, and accountability.

### 2. The real enemy is silent drift

Systems fail slowly when meanings erode and rules are bent implicitly.

### 3. Unknown risks cannot be eliminated — only contained and learned from

Detection, isolation, and learning matter more than prediction.

### 4. Humans remain sovereign over meaning and authority

No concept, policy, or core rule may change without explicit human approval.

### 5. Strategic optionality must be preserved

### 6. Data is Sovereign and Incorruptible (The Iron Ledger)

- Data integrity is as critical as logic.
- The 'Database Architect' is the sole custodian of schema truth.
- The 'Chaos Agent' perpetually tests resilience, but never corruption.

## 🎯 Objectives

### 🛡️ Governance Objectives

- Prevent conceptual drift
- Enforce policy boundaries
- Maintain human accountability
- Preserve long‑term system integrity

### 🧠 Knowledge Objectives

- Build institutional memory
- Capture architectural decisions as reusable knowledge
- Enable traceable reasoning

### ⚙️ Operational Objectives

- Support complex architectural decisions
- Reduce long‑term risk
- Standardize decision quality

---

## 🧩 Core Architecture (The Kernel)

### 🧠 Knowledge Base

Canonical source of truth:

- Concepts
- Policies
- Sentinel Signals
- ADRs
- Human Decisions
- Learning Logs

### 🔁 ICGL — Iterative Co‑Governance Loop

The evolution engine. Every important decision flows through governance before execution.

**Tamper-evident chain:** Signed decisions are chained via Merkle-style hashing in `data/logs/decisions.merkle` for auditability.

### 🛡️ Sentinel

System immune layer. Detects drift, unknown risks, violations, and instability.

### 🧬 Concept Guardian

Protects conceptual integrity. Prevents implicit redefinition of meaning.

### 🏛️ HDAL — Human Decision Authority Layer

Final human authority. All sovereign decisions must be signed by a human.

### ⚖️ Policies

Hard constraints that cannot be overridden by optimization or voting.

## 🔁 How It Operates (Lifecycle)

1. Proposal submitted
2. ADR drafted
3. Policy gate enforced
4. Sentinel scanning
5. Agent analysis and synthesis
6. Human sovereign decision
7. Knowledge base update
8. Next iteration

---

## 🧪 Current State

The current repository contains:

- A Python skeleton architecture
- Canonical schemas
- In‑memory Knowledge Base
- ICGL orchestrator
- Sentinel stub
- HDAL stub

This is intentionally minimal and governance‑focused.

---

## 🚀 Future Directions

This core can evolve into:

- 🧩 Personal cognitive engine
- 🏗️ Commercial product
- 🏢 Enterprise governance platform
- 🧪 Research laboratory

Without changing the foundational architecture.
