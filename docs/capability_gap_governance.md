# Capability Gap Governance Charter

## Purpose
The purpose of this charter is to outline the governance framework for detecting and addressing capability gaps within the organization. This includes the identification of gaps, proposal of solutions, and implementation of actions with the aim of continuously improving organizational capabilities.

## Scope
This charter applies to all areas of the organization where capability gaps may be identified. It encompasses all processes, tools, and personnel involved in the gap detection and resolution process.

## Gap Detection Pipeline
The gap detection pipeline is a structured process for identifying capability gaps. It includes mechanisms for monitoring, analysis, and reporting of potential gaps.

## Agent Proposal Flow
The agent proposal flow outlines the process for agents to submit proposals for addressing identified gaps. All proposals require human sign-off before proceeding to implementation. This ensures that all actions are thoroughly reviewed and align with organizational goals and standards.

## Sign-off Process
The sign-off process requires that all proposals are reviewed by designated personnel with the authority to approve or reject proposals. This step is crucial for maintaining control over the implementation of changes and ensuring they are in the best interest of the organization.

## Amendments
This charter is subject to amendments as the organization evolves. Changes to the charter require approval through the established governance process.
