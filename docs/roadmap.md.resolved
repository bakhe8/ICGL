# 🗺️ ICGL Product Roadmap & Backlog

This document outlines the evolutionary path from the current **Mechanical Prototype** to a **Production Sovereign System**.

> **Current Status:**
> - ✅ Governance Pipeline (Functional)
> - ✅ Policy & Sentinel Engines (Functional)
> - ❌ Intelligence Layer (Mocked)
> - ❌ Semantic Memory (Missing)

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: The "Hitchhiker" (Intelligence Injection)
**Goal:** Replace mock logic with real LLM reasoning.

### 1.1 Model Interface
- [ ] Implement `LLMProvider` interface (Abstract Base Class).
- [ ] Support **OpenAI** (GPT-4o) via API.
- [ ] Support **Ollama** (Llama 3 / Mistral) for local sovereignty.

### 1.2 Enhanced Agent Logic
- [ ] **Architect Agent**: Parsing actual diffs => structured analysis.
- [ ] **Sentinel Agent**: Detecting semantic drift using LLM reasoning (not just regex).
- [ ] **Guardian**: Comparing concept definitions semantically.

---

## 🧠 Phase 2: The "Librarian" (Semantic Memory)
**Goal:** Give the system long-term semantic recall.

### 2.1 Vector Database Integration
- [ ] Integrate **Qdrant** or **ChromaDB** (Dockerized).
- [ ] Auto-embed all new ADRs, Policies, and Concepts.

### 2.2 Semantic Search Capabilities
- [ ] Query: "Find previous decisions about *State Management*" (even if keywords differ).
- [ ] **Drift Detection**: Calculate Cosine Similarity between "Old Concept" and "New Usage".

---

## 🔐 Phase 3: The "Notary" (Sovereign Security)
**Goal:** Cryptographic proof of human authority.

### 3.1 Crypto-Signature
- [ ] Replace text string `signed-by:bakheet` with **SSH / GPG Signature**.
- [ ] Verify signatures in the pipeline (Reject invalid signatures).

### 3.2 Ledger Integrity
- [ ] Merkle Tree hashing for the LearningLog (Tamper-evident chain).

---

## 🖥️ Phase 4: The "Cockpit" (Experience Layer)
**Goal:** Frictionless governance workflow.

### 4.1 VS Code Webview
- [ ] Render `Review Package` as a rich HTML view inside VS Code.
- [ ] Side-by-side Diff Viewer for Concept changes.
- [ ] "Approve" button triggers local signing.

### 4.2 Dashboard
- [ ] Visualization of System Health (Sentinel Alerts vs Time).
- [ ] Network graph of Concept dependencies.

---

## 🏗️ Phase 5: The "Engineer" (GitOps)
**Goal:** Governance as Code.

### 5.1 Git Integration
- [ ] **Auto-Commit**: ICGL commits accepted ADRs to the git repo automatically.
- [ ] **Signed Commits**: Commits signed by the Governance Bot identity.

### 5.2 CI/CD Gates
- [ ] Run `icgl kb validate` and `icgl sentinel scan` in GitHub Actions.
- [ ] Block PRs if Governance Policies fail.

## 📋 Priority Queue (Next Steps)

1.  **LLM Connector** (Enable real thinking)
2.  **Vector Store** (Enable real memory)
3.  **Git integration** (Enable real persistence)
