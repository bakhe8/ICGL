# Pilot Post-Execution Report: ADR-PILOT-OPS-05-001

**Title:** Controlled External Notification Hook (Slack)  
**Date:** 2026-01-17  
**Status:** SUCCESSFUL PILOT (Pending General Adoption Decision)

## 1. Protocol Verification (IDCP Compliance)

| Stage | Compliance | Proof |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Need Detection** | ✅ | OperationalRequest created by `MonitorAgent`. |
| **Formal Request** | ✅ | Logged in KB with Rationale/Urgency. |
| **Decision Hub** | ✅ | Elevated to CEO; `ADR-PILOT-OPS-05-001` issued. |
| **Execution Gate** | ✅ | No direct system write; Adapter-based outbound only. |
| **Traceability** | ✅ | 100% link from Request ID to ADR ID to Execution Event. |

## 2. Technical Performance

* **Latency:** Request to ADR took ~2 minutes (Simulated). Execution to Notification ~200ms.
* **Filtering:** Only `CRITICAL` categories triggered Slack. `INFO` events were correctly discarded.
* **Isolation:** `Sentinel` core was NOT modified. Integration was via `MonitorLoop` adapter.

## 3. Sovereign Constraint Audit

* **Outbound Only:** Verified. No ingress webhooks or control loops implemented.
* **Kill Switch:** Functional. Mechanical override tested successfully in stress test.
* **Scope Lock:** Fixed channel and specific alert categories (Drift, Integrity, Policy).

## 4. Identified Friction Points

* **Manual Mapping:** The link between an `OperationalRequest` and an `ADR` requires formal manual tagging in the current version.
* **Schema Rigidity:** Schemas for `ADR` require list inputs which can be simplified for fast-track pilot decisions.

## 5. Architectural Recommendation

The pilot proves that **Governed Autonomy** is viable. We recommend adopting the **"Adapter-only External Integration"** as a standard for all future Agent Resource requests.
