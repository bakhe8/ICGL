Define WorkspaceProps interface: currentWorkspace?: string, onSwitch?: (id: string) => void\n4. Create WorkspaceSelector functional component that:\n   - Fetches workspaces from /api/workspaces on mount\n   - Displays a dropdown/select showing workspace names\n   - Shows current workspace with mode badge (NORMAL=blue, SANDBOX=yellow, JOURNAL=purple)\n   - Has 'Create Workspace' button that prompts for name and creates via POST\n   - Calls onSwitch when user selects different workspace\n5. Use Tailwind CSS classes matching existing components\n6. Add proper TypeScript types for Workspace: {id: string, name: string, mode: string, created_at: string}\n\nMake it clean, modern, and match the design of other components like ProposalCard.",
